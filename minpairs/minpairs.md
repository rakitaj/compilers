Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, find all pairs of numbers that have the minimum absolute difference among all possible pairs in the array. Print these pairs in ascending order.

Input
An unsorted array of unique integers
Example: [-2, -4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]
Expected Output
Print each pair that has the minimum absolute difference, with each pair on a new line. Within each pair, print the smaller number first, then the larger number.

Example Outputs
Example 1:

(The minimum difference is 1, occurring between (1,2), (2,3), and (5,6))

Example 2:

(The minimum difference is 1)

Example 3:

(The minimum difference is 2, occurring only between (1,3))

Function Signature
The function should print the results directly (void function) rather than returning a value.
```python
def print_minimum_difference_pairs(arr: List[int]) -> None:
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```
